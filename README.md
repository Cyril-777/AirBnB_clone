This directory contains the completed tasks in the 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console Project.

This project is a group project inn which we have been tasked to create a console, that much behaves like a shell.

The Console
Is a shell like application that allows the user to interact with a user based the commands entered. We have been tasked to create a consule with the use of the cmd module. Inside the cmd module we have access to the Cmd class. This will act as the base class for the generation of instances, methods and attributes that will mirror the AirBNB website

JSON
Json is the industry accepted notoation used to transfer  and store files. This will beb useful as we will be tasked with sending our data across different storage engines. Json is suited to this and so we must store/ write and open our files with json for easy flow of the data we/user will e storing through the classes we have created on our console.

Unit Testing
Our project files, classes etc are to conform to all Unit testing standards with as mamny edge cases applied as is possible
